	<h1>We are here to help.</h1>
	<br>
	<p>The purpose of our COVID testing site is to help stop the spread of COVID through education and easy access to affordable testing. Unfortunately, today, there are no rapid COVID testing providers within reasonable proximity to this location, a densely populated suburban area comprised of not only traditional families, but high-risk individuals as well.

In addition to providing an easily accessible testing resource for the Multan Community, our plan is to capitalize on our existing knowledge and experience of the COVID testing process to maximize test efficiency, and therefore, be able to offer testing services at a significantly more affordable rate than test sites in the surrounding area. 

Ultimately, MSR Testing is excited to help make The Shoppes at Maheen Plazza a hero of the community, as well as a safer place to shop.</p>
