	<h3> How does the process work?</h3>
	<p>
Select one of our three available appointment types (Rapid Antigen Testing, RT-PCR Testing, or Flu A/B), select a time that works for you, fill out the intake form and enter your payment information. Show up at the time you registered and follow the instructions in the email you provided to proceed with the testing process.
</p>
<h3>What is the difference between the three test types?</h3>
<p>Rapid Antigen Testing tests for an active COVID-19 infection for patients that have had possible exposure to the COVID-19 virus after 5 days or if they are showing symptoms related to COVID-19. Results are ready in approximately 10 minutes.

RT-PCR Testing detects an active COVID-19 infection for patients who have had a possible exposure to COVID-19 within 3-5 days or experiencing COVID-19 symptoms. Results from this test are available after roughly 1 hours. </p>
<h3>What if I had another question?</h3>
<p>Please email us at support@MSRclinic.com and someone will get back to you within two business days. </p>
